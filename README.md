# serveit

Dead simple static http server written in Go. Essentially,
it is a simple convenience exposed as a tool, that is already
documented in the standard Library.

## Installation

	$ go get ronoaldo.gopkg.net/serveit

## Running

If your `$GOBIN` is in your `$PATH`:

	$ serveit

It starts serving the local directory at port 8080. Options to
change port/root comming in the next releases.
